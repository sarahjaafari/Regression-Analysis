# Regression-Analysis

This study investigates trends in student quiz performance over time, with a focus on gender and major-based differences. Using data from a statistics class, I employ regression analysis to assess whether quiz scores improve throughout the semester, and whether demographic factors influence performance. Findings indicate a general upward trend in quiz scores, with minor variations across gender and significant differences among majors. The study provides insights into student learning patterns, informing potential strategies for academic interventions and course design improvements.

I implemented multiple regression models, including base, interaction, and polynomial models, to investigate quiz performance trends. While the base model effectively captured the primary trends, more complex models did not significantly improve explanatory power. This analysis underscores the importance of model selection in balancing interpretability and statistical significance.
